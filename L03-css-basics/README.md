# Lecture 03 – CSS Basics

## What I implemented this lecture
- Added a futuristic CSS design using dark colors and neon accents
- Improved readability with typography rules (font, line height, headings sizes)
- Structured the page layout with spacing, centered content, and responsive media

## CSS selectors I used (at least 5)
- Element selector (`body`, `h1`, `h2`, `img`)
- Group selector (`header, footer`)
- Descendant selector (`header h1`, `nav a`)
- Class selector (`.card`)
- ID selector (`#main`)
- Pseudo-class selector (`a:hover`)

## One thing I struggled with
- Making sure all images and embedded content stay responsive without breaking the layout

## One improvement I want to do next
- Add a real navigation bar with animations and improve mobile responsiveness
