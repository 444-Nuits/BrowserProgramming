# Lecture 02 – Semantic HTML & Structure

## 1. What I implemented this lecture
- Created a web page using semantic HTML elements
- Structured the page with header, main, section, figure, and footer
- Added basic accessibility features required by the lecture

## 2. Semantic decisions I made

### Decision 1
- Element(s) used: `<header>`
- Where in the page: At the top of the page
- Why this element is semantically correct:
  The header contains the main title (h1) and introductory personal information, which represents the introduction of the page.

### Decision 2
- Element(s) used: `<section>`
- Where in the page: Portfolio section and Areas of Interest section
- Why this element is semantically correct:
  Each section groups related content under a meaningful heading, improving structure and readability.

### Decision 3
- Element(s) used: `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`
- Where in the page: Around images and embedded video in the portfolio
- Why this element is semantically correct:
  These elements associate visual media with descriptive captions, which is useful for both semantics and accessibility.

## 3. Accessibility considerations
- Added a skip link to allow users to jump directly to the main content
- Used alt text for all images
- Followed correct heading hierarchy (h1 → h2)
These features improve navigation for screen readers and keyboard users.
